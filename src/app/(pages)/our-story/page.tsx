                            At our core, we believe that every individual deserves the opportunity to flourish, regardless of how they process and learn. Sadly, this isn&quot;t the reality for many of the 70 million people in the United States—approximately 1 in 5—who face learning and thinking differences.

                            Our journey began over 30 years ago when we discovered that our son, Max, had a learning and thinking difference. Through personal experience, we encountered the challenges and uncertainties that so many others in similar situations face. This journey is ongoing and lifelong.

                        <p className="mt-3 text-lg text-gray-600 my-1 w-75 mx-auto mb-3">
                            From this experience, three key insights emerged. First, we learned how swiftly life changes upon recognizing a learning and thinking difference and how much there is to comprehend. Second, we realized the difficulty in accessing necessary information and support for our child—something millions of other parents also grapple with. Third, we witnessed firsthand the remarkable strengths that arise from these differences, as exemplified by Max. Today, with the support we provided, Max thrives. Along this path, we discovered newfound strengths, a sense of purpose, and a supportive community.

                            These insights inspired us to create Understood—an initiative dedicated to offering parents and families worldwide the resources, expertise, and community that were once scarce.

                            Admittedly, we embarked on this journey uncertain of its destination. Yet, we understood that everyone knows someone affected by a learning and thinking difference—our children, siblings, friends, neighbors, and colleagues. If we didn&quot;t act, these individuals could face increased risks such as bullying, academic struggles, or unemployment, hindering their ability to thrive.
